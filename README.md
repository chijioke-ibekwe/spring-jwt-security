## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This is a fully configured Spring Security JWT module using the new Spring Boot 3 and Spring Security 6 
frameworks. It provides spring security JWT configurations you need to quickly bootstrap your small to medium scale 
projects. This project is configured to issue self-signed JWTs which eliminate the need to introduce a standalone 
authorization server. The following features are supported:
- User registration
- User login using their username and password
- API method security with user roles and permissions

**If you find this project useful, kindly drop a star on this repo. I'd really appreciate it üôÇ.**

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
### Prerequisites  
To successfully use this project, you'll need the following installed on your machine:
- **JDK >= v17.** That is because this project was developed using Spring Boot 3, which requires Java 17
as a minimum version.
- **Apache Maven**
- **Docker**
- **OpenSSL**

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
To use this project:
1. Fork the repository

2. Clone the repository using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<your-git-username>/spring-security-jwt.git
   ```
3. A docker compose file is attached to this project to help you easily set up a development database. To do this,
   run the following command in your terminal from the root directory of the project
   ```
   docker compose up -d
   ```
   This command will spin-up the following containers running in a detached mode: 
   - A postgres database running on `localhost:5431`, and 
   - A pgAdmin UI running on `localhost:5050` for managing the database.

4. Using the `pgAdmin` interface or your `psql`, create a database called `spring-security-jwt`. If you wish to name 
   this database something different, make sure to update the database configuration in the `application.yml` file.

5. Generate the asymmetric keys for encrypting and decrypting the JWT, by running the `generate_keys.sh` script
   from the root directory of the project using:
   ```
   ./generate_keys.sh
   ```
   Ensure that the generated keys directory is git ignored to prevent committing them to source control
6. Lastly, run the following command to start the application, or simply run the `JwtSecurityApplication.java` class 
   via your IDE:
   ```
   mvn clean compile exec:java
   ```
   Liquibase will run the migration files within the `resources/db` directory, upon startup, to set up the database.
   The schema created will have the following structure.  
   <img height="400" src="./src/main/resources/db/erd.png" width="600"/>

   Feel free to begin customizations!
